Tricircle is a openstack project that aims to deal with OpenStack deployment across multiple sites. It provides users a single management view by having only one OpenStack instance on behalf of all the involved ones. It essentially serves as a communication bus between the central OpenStack instance and the other OpenStack instances that are called upon.
